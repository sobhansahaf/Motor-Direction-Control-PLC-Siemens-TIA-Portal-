# Motor-Direction-Control-PLC-Siemens-TIA-Portal-
This project demonstrates a simple PLC-based motor control system using two start buttons (Left Rotation and Right Rotation), one stop button, and a single motor. The logic is designed so that the motor can switch between left and right rotation with a 5-second delay between direction changes to ensure safe operation.
